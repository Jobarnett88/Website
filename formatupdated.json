We will start at the CA, then move on to Seegers, then on to the Chaplain's house, then end up at the President's house, with Latin holiday treats at our last two stops, generously funded by the President's office. What are Posadas? They are a song cycle from 16th century Mexico. They are similar to carols, in that a group of singers moves from one home to another.Posadas they are different in that they follow the Advent story of the refugee family of Mary and Joseph as they travel through foreign lands in search of a place where Mary can have here child --that would be the baby Jesus!-- in safety and whatever comfort they can find. The songs recount the pleas for shelter, the rejection that followed, and eventually, the welcoming of this migrant family. Por supuesto, this is a powerful reminder of today's situation of migrants crossing borders and facing hostility... with a happy ending that we hope will inspire us all. Plus, the music is truly lovely.   Please mention this to your students, put it on your calendars... we will have a time set before the 3rd to practice... though practice is NOT required for this to be a success.",
